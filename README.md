# Shop4Clothes

### A way to shop for clothes for people who don't like shopping for clothes.

##Overview
This is the front-end implementation of a website designed to aggregate clothing from various retailers, making it easier to shop for basic clothes without visiting multiple sites. For the purposes of this project I used mock data of shirts, shoes, and pants, from a few clothing stores for illustration.
