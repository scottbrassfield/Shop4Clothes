# Shop4Clothes

### A way to shop for clothes for people who don't like shopping for clothes.

This is the front-end implementation of a website designed to aggregate clothing from various retailers, making it easier to shop for basic clothes without visiting multiple sites.  

In the working version, users can do the following:
- Search for items
- View individual product pages
- Add, remove, and update items in a shopping cart
- Review orders
- Input order information and submit an order

Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Underscore.js


**This site does not currently pull data from actual retailers, but uses mock data from a few stores for illustration.
